## Anomaly Detection: Algorithms, Explanations, Applications

*Anomaly detection* is important for data cleaning, cybersecurity, and robust AI systems. This talk will review recent work in our group on (a) benchmarking existing algorithms, (b) developing a theoretical understanding of their behavior, (c) explaining anomaly "alarms" to a data analyst, and (d) interactively re-ranking candidate anomalies in response to analyst feedback. Then the talk will describe two applications: (a) detecting and diagnosing sensor failures in weather networks and (b) open category detection in supervised learning.
